## Personal site Scrimba tutorial

I have created this site for Scrimba tutorial and want to upload to Github as project website. I already have GitHub page from before. 

For some reason I was not able to upload this little personal site to Github - keep getting 404 error.  

- My task - to upload this site as Github project site:
  AstaRem.github.io/personal-site-for-scrimba

- Update - I have resolved issue and uploaded my page as project. I have deleted the old repository on Github, created it again and pushed my files from local computer to Github repository.  But this time I was making sure I drag and drop EACH  file into repository, not the whole directory (if you drag-and-drop the whole directory, it adds one level in the path).
